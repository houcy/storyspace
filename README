SCENE LIST
=============================================================================
---start&end---
end-scene : shows 'continue' button that leads back to initial scene
init-choice-scene : shows an array of characters, each leading to a different story scene
init-session-scene : shows an array of buttons, each leading to a the set of stories
  for the selected SR2 or SR3 study session
init-start-scene : shows 'start' button so you can advance to the first story scene
mid-wait-scene : shows 'continue' button so you can continue to the next story scene

---storyscenes---
note that the story numbers below reflect the order in which the scenes were created, not some other more important numbering schema, so they can be safely ignored.
-----------------
story01-penguins : an iceberg scene with two penguins and a seal
story02-aliens : a Mars/space scene with three aliens; usually referred to as the Mars scene
story03-dragon : a meadow scene with a dragon, a bird, and a butterlfy; usually referred to as the Treemeadow scene
story04-pineforest : a forest scene with a rabbit, a turtle, and a squirrel
story05-dinosaur : a desert pond scene with three dinosaurs; usually referred to as the Dinoville scene
story06-playground : a playground scene with three children
story07-house : a living room scene with a girl, a dog, and a cat
story08-castle : a castle scene with a prince, a princess, and a crocodile

STARTING SCENES
=============================================================================
Two different starting scenes are provided.
'init-choice-scene' allows the user to select any story scene to play.
'init-session-scene' takes the user to the stories for a particular Storybot user study session.

Currently everything is set up to use the session selector.

When switching back to using the choice scene at the start instead, one would
change several things:
-- the behavior of the 'back' arrow (tagged with TAG_ARROW; when touched, go to CheckTouch, which will leads to ReturnToBeginning, but desired behavior might be in ReturnToSessionSelection, or just mod ReturnToBeginning to go to the correct init scene)
-- which scene is in the build order (check init-choice, uncheck init-session)
-- add the StoryspaceMainBehavior script to the Director in each of the story scenes

=============================================================================
PLAYBACKS
=============================================================================
The playback files provided in the Logs/playbacks directory accompany a set of scripted stories for each scene. These files can be played back in accompaniment with recorded audio of the stories. 

The audio and script files for the stories currently exist in r1d1's contentroot.

=============================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES & THINGS TO FIX
=============================================================================
-- If the TCP server running elsewhere closes and restarts, the game will not try to reconnect.
-- All TCP communication needs to be separated out from the StoryspaceMainInteraction script. Then the main interaction stuff (e.g., responses to touch/drag events) can still be attached separately to the Director in each story scene, which would allow you to play any of the story scenes as standalone scenes. At present, since the StoryspaceMainInteraction script contains more than it should, that script is attached to a persistent object from the initial session select scene, and the same script can't be present in future loaded scenes, which means story scenes are not standalone scenes ... basically, there are some issues with how the code is presently organized, and some reorganization is necessary.
-- There are a bunch of TODOs in the code; those are all things to fix.
